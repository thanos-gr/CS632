Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 

*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 

*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 

Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 

*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.",1

"Re: Realtek ethernet (was Re: recent mobo recommendation)Ron Johnson put forth on 4/14/2010 10:14 PM:

> Nothing I've seen in dmesg has ever led me to think that the r8169
> driver in my Sid linux-source-2.6.31 kernel (yes, it's old; .32 and 33
> fail to build) loads a blob.

Almost all NICs load firmware blobs.  It's in dmesg somewhere.  When the
firmware doesn't load you get something like this in dmesg:

eth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, XID 083000c0
IRQ 32
eth1: unable to apply firmware patch

That's a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk
upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob.

I can't find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load.
Here's what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the
firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel:

e100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin

""built-in"" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel
at compile time.  I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem.  It
only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image.  And I use the vanilla
kernel.org sources to avoid any Debian ""non-free"" issues.

Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob.  There are, IIRC, 3
ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel.  This applies to all
devices that require soft firmware, not just NICs:

1.  Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel
2.  Compile the individual blob into the driver, use initrd
3.  Put firmware file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path

#3 won't work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as
block device drivers.  Those require method 1 or 2.  NICs should be able to
use 1-3.

There are 3 different dmesg statements and 3 different errors depending on
which method 1-3 above that you're using.

Yeah, I just pulled the mails.  One upgraded to 2.6.32-trunk on his
firewall, bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an
Intel e100 IIRC.  They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the
firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email.  The other
had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason.  I can't recall how
they fixed that one.  IIRC the OP didn't swap hardware to achieve the fix,
so they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware.

Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what
transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip.  I bet you get 1/3rd wire
speed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that.  The machines themselves need to
be modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks.  Any ~2GHz CPU with
512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s
across the wire.  For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB
RAM disk on each machine.  Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back
and forth between the RAM disks.  If your RTL chip can peak the wire it'll
be a 2-3 second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up
to the task.

> Maybe if I ever get .32 or .33 I'll squeal in anger.  Until then...

It's looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the
trunk kernel.  You may get lucky.  Then again, if you roll your own and put
the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do, you shouldn't have a
problem.  That is, if the Debian kernel source doesn't have the blob ripped
out for being ""non-free"".

You mentioned you had problems building 2.6.32 and .33 kernel source.  Do
you use the Debian kernel source or kernel.org source?  I've been using the
kernel.org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems
with it (knocks on wood).  I had a build problem with .33 a while back but
that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine
in this warmer weather.  ;)

FWIW, if you'd like to rely on such a scheme for security by obstacles,
you'd have to use something else than pdf. pdf's scheme is broken.
That's all.

The reason that it is broken for pdfs is that the specifications for pdf
are freely available, and thus alternative pdf readers have been
developed. Your scheme would require closed specifications and closed
software to work. This list, however, is all about free software.

What ""long, rude, unpleasant emails"" have I sent to you? Go ahead,

All I did was ask about what issues you have with KDE 4 so that I
might fix them. You don't have to appreciate that, but I do not expect
you to turn it around and call that ""rude and unpleasant"". Maybe you
don't like KDE contributors taking an interest in your problems with
the software. Many other people do.

In my experience it's probably better to use an external database 
(MySQL) with amarok because it's faster to load. Anyhow, it still 
happens that the changes you make to the tracks/albums don't show 
immediately in the database. Bye

When is an 'appropriate' time?

And how do Apple decide which User Groups to 'acknowledge in a proud  
fashion'
There are groups out there that only have a dozen or so members.  
Others seem to a large portion of members still using PowerPC based  
machines. And from my experience, it seems very few 'traditional' user  
groups actually cater for the demographic that Apple is now chasing.

"Get the lowest possible interest rate for you--GUARANTEED.Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

That's true.  I used to say and think that ... back around 1992 when
I started to use DEC Alpha machines.  But now that 2GB is about as
little RAM as you can get in a new machine, the push to move to 64bit is
very real.

Hard-drive-based MP3 players, which allow you to store massive 
amounts of MP3s and other files on a portable device, have been 
around for a few years. But recently, three new players have 
taken the concept to a new high with impressive advancements 
in design, functionality, and interface. Each has its unique 
strong points, but they're all groundbreaking in their own way.

Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is=20
layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some=20
technology that can be bonded (like ADSL).

AFAIU what you need is BGP[1], but I can't give you any tips as this is=20
way out of my league ;)

Probably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a=20
GNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links=20
and your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more=20
than one WAN port[2].

This is a good thing to look into. Now I am experiencing a interlude

CONSANTLY being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (I have been self-employed all my life), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (great! because
I had none) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (when) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.

This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: Whats it all about? and How
does it work?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! 

I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life yeah, right!

I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. 

You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! 

Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!

Lucky you, but it must be because of the version. Note that it does
not _always_ hang here, that's purely random.

NB: This is my best recollection; I'm not looking this up right now.  Pleas=

check my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.

Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, whi=
ch=20
I believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came=
=20
from tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and=20

flushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs h=

likely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching=

system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.

Not really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very=
=20
long time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated=
 to=20
use the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that=
=20
will not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the=
=20
reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t=
he=20
ext2/3/4 or xfs code.

In addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less=
=20
attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a=
way=20
from it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outs=
ide=20
of generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which=20

=20
such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an=
d=20
fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The=
=20
source will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in f=
ile=20
systems are not interested in reiserfs.

There's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no=
=20
pressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20
systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser=

  | How about something like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This

  | the owners too... :)
  | 
  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

 the above (or something close to it) will work.

 however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).

 the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media.

 the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)

cheers!
