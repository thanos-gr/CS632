Hi Professor,

Unfortunately my PC crashed during training, and is unable to train and provide the weights. Please run train.py to
generate the weights.hdf5 file and provide the name on the predict.py WEIGHTS global variable.

I will try to regenerate the files to save you some time as it is a big network that takes time to train but provides 
promising results.

Additionally, you can use the word2vec file I sent you form my Gmail account with a link to my Drive, since I was not
able to upload it directly on the repository, or run the w2v.py to generate one with your specifications.

Please reach out to me if you encouter any problems.

Thank you for a wonderful semester!

Have a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year for you and your family!

All the best,
Athanasios
